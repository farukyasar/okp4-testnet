This repository contains the official genesis files and network information for the various [OKP4](https://okp4.network) networks. Additionally, you'll find for each network, the instructions to register your validator node in the genesis, if applicable.

For a complete description about nodes and validators, check out the [OKP4 Documentation site](https://docs.okp4.network/docs/nodes/introduction).

This was the first OKP4 `testnet` but it is now discontinued.

The main development network, intended primarily for use by the OKP4 core team. Unstable (the chain can be reinitialized without notice), experimental, with restricted access.

## üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Want to become a validator?

Validators are responsible for securing the okp4 network. Validator responsibilities include maintaining a functional [node](https://docs.okp4.network/docs/nodes/run-node) with constant uptime and providing a sufficient amount of $KNOW as stake. In exchange for this service, validators receive block rewards and transaction fees!

So, want to become a validator?
